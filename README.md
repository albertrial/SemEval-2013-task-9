This repository contains different approaches to address the SemEval 2013 Task 9. This task concerns the recognition of drugs and extraction of drug-drug interactions that appear in biomedical literature. It is divided in two subtasks:
- Task 9.1: Recognition and classification of drug names.
- Task 9.2: Detection and classification of drug-drug interactions between pairs of drugs.

In the source folder you will find several jupyter notebooks containing each one a different approach. There are also two notebooks (one per subtask) called *report.ipynb* where you can find the explanation of each approach taken and the results obtained.

## Results
The best results obtained are the following:
#### Task 9.1 (NERC)
- Devel set: precision 0.95, recall 0.73, F1 0.79
- Test set: precision 0.9, recall 0.64, F1 0.69
##### Task 9.2 (DDI)
- Devel set: precision 0.68, recall 0.62, F1 0.65
- Test set: precision 0.52, recall 0.59, F1 0.55
