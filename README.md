This repository contains different approaches to address the SemEval 2013 Task 9 (Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from BioMedical Texts)
This task is divided in two subtasks:
- Task 9.1: Recognition and classification of drug names.
- Task 9.2: Detection and classification of drug-drug interactions between pairs of drugs.

In the source folder you will find several jupyter notebooks containing each one a different approach. There are also two notebooks (one per subtask) called *report.ipynb* where you can find the explanation of each approach taken and the results obtained.
